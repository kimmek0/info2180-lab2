                    I believe I speak for many when I say morning coffee is a must have. I’m already having a bad day if I dare to start my day without a hot cup of cappuccino.  Even though I enjoy every sip, there are some thoughts that linger in the back of my mind each time I take another sip. How bad is coffee for my body? How many calories are in my cup of coffee today? How many cups should I drink a day? Today, I am going to share the answers I found to these questions so I can help another worrying coffee lover! First question, just how bad is coffee for my body? Coffee overall has positive impacts on our bodies. It can help to reduce brain fog, reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes, improves metabolic rates, boosts long-term memory by helping to ward off cognitive decline and so much more. You might be thinking, oh yeah? Give me more coffee!
                </p>
                <p>As we all know, anything in excess is never good. Becoming addicted to coffee is not so much a good thing because you may suffer withdrawal symptoms. But not to worry, there is an easy way to prevent that and its just by watching your intake. On average, the regular person is safe drinking 3-5 cups per day. Ultimately its up to you to know how much is too much based on your bodily responses, and this can be used to judge whether 5 cups of coffee a day is a bit too much. Mind you, many of us add extras to our morning coffee. Which leads me to my last question, how much calories are in my cup of coffee? This one is a little harder to answer because it varies depending on the type of coffee, type of milk, and the amount of sugar/syrup added. A standard cup of black coffee (around 8oz) contains 1 calorie, but a cappuccino for example can contain anywhere from 60 to 160 calories, depending on the type of milk you take and the size of the cappuccino. For a low-calorie coffee, switch the sugar to sweeteners, and switch full milk to skim or soy (or cut out the milk altogether!). 
                All in all, drinking a reasonable amount of coffee a day is good for you. So take that next sip and worry less.

                <h2>The Power Behind Writing Your Goals on Paper</h2>
                <p class="dated">September 12, 2021 by Jacobs</p>

                    As Abraham Lincoln said, “the best way to predict the future is to create it”. Writing down your goals is a pretty simple thing to do, yet it is so powerful. And here’s why- writing down your goals makes them feel more tangible. The process helps you to be intellectually engage and emotionally connected with the results of the goals you want to achieve. This is powerful because you will commit to achieving them. And your attitude will change as a result. The first thing you will want to do in the mornings is to review yesterday’s performance and make real progress each day.</p>
                <p> This sets you apart from everybody else who have goals because- You have a clear focus on what it is you need to do each day to get to a certain marker. This is what many persons lack. When we humans are able to see something clearly, it changes our attitude because we now have clarity and a sense of direction. Productivity then comes easily. Writing down your goals plants the seed in your brain, and once you make the effort to water it every day, it will grow. Most people have goals- if not everyone, but its not written down. That makes it more of a wish than a goal, because, you have no set deadlines, no schedules or measurements set specifically for achieving them. Writing down your goals is the starting of the process and that what many of us don’t understand- without a beginning there is no ending. 
                    To wrap up, writing down your goals on paper is important because:
                    <br>
                    It helps to clarify what it is you want.
                    <br>
                    It keeps you motivated.
                    <br>
                    It narrows you focus.
                    <br>
                    It provides realistic time frames to work with. 
                    <br>
                    It allows you to celebrate your progress.
